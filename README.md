# SourceCheck WMS SSI UI

Frontend App (Web UI) for SourceCheck's [WMS SSI
project](https://github.com/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-prototype).

The application is based on the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

It's necessary to have the backend application (API server) running. More
information on that can be found in the [WMS SSI
API](https://github.com/SourceCheckOrg/wms-ssi-api) repository. 

## Development environment setup

### Node.js

A recent version of Node.js is required to run the Web UI app.

We recommended using Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
to install Node.js in Linux and MacOS environments.

The code was created using `v14.15.3`.

### SSI tooling

The WMS SSI project depends on SSI components developed by [Spruce
Systems](https://spruceid.com). See their [Developer
Portal](https://spruceid.dev/docs/) for more information.

The frontend application (Web UI) requires Spruce's Credible wallet for the sign
up process as well as for signing in. Any standards-conformant SSI wallet should
be usable in its place with a little effort.

Setup the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST` in the file
